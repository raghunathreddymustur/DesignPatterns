# Proxy Design Pattern

## Overview

The Proxy Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides an object representing another object. This proxy object controls access to the original object, which can help in implementing additional functionalities such as lazy initialization, access control, logging, or caching.

## When to Use

- When you need to control access to an object, adding functionality such as lazy initialization, access control, or logging.
- When working with remote objects that require communication across address spaces.
- When managing expensive resources that should be loaded or created only when necessary. 


## Intent

- To provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object.
- To control access to the original object and add additional behavior without modifying the original object's code.

## Example

The Logging Proxy Design Pattern is a variant of the Proxy Design Pattern where the proxy object logs interactions with the real subject. This pattern is useful for monitoring and debugging by capturing method calls and their results, without modifying the original object's code.

## Intent

- To log method calls and their parameters.
- To capture the results or side effects of method calls for debugging or monitoring purposes.
- To provide an additional layer of abstraction for logging without altering the real objectâ€™s code.

## Example

### Scenario

Consider a banking application where transactions are performed on a bank account. By using a Logging Proxy, you can intercept and log each transaction operation, such as deposits and withdrawals, without changing the logic of the `BankAccount` class.

### Components

1. **Real Object**: Represents the actual subject with the core functionality.
2. **Proxy**: Implements the same interface as the real object and adds logging behavior.

### Example Structure

1. **RealBankAccount**: The real object that performs transactions.
2. **LoggingProxy**: The proxy that logs method calls and delegates to the real object.

## Implementation

### RealBankAccount

The `RealBankAccount` class includes methods for depositing and withdrawing funds.

### LoggingProxy

The `LoggingProxy` class implements the same interface as `RealBankAccount`, logs the method calls and their parameters, and then forwards the calls to the real object.

## Code Example

```java
// Interface
public interface BankAccount {
    void deposit(double amount);
    void withdraw(double amount);
}

// Real Object
public class RealBankAccount implements BankAccount {
    private double balance;

    @Override
    public void deposit(double amount) {
        balance += amount;
        System.out.println("Deposited " + amount);
    }

    @Override
    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        balance -= amount;
        System.out.println("Withdrew " + amount);
    }
}

// Proxy
public class LoggingProxy implements BankAccount {
    private RealBankAccount realAccount;

    public LoggingProxy(RealBankAccount realAccount) {
        this.realAccount = realAccount;
    }

    @Override
    public void deposit(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Logging: Depositing " + amount);
        realAccount.deposit(amount);
    }

    @Override
    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Logging: Withdrawing " + amount);
        realAccount.withdraw(amount);
    }
}

public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create the real bank account
        RealBankAccount realAccount = new RealBankAccount();

        // Create a logging proxy for the real bank account
        BankAccount proxyAccount = new LoggingProxy(realAccount);

        // Perform operations through the proxy
        proxyAccount.deposit(100.0);
        proxyAccount.withdraw(50.0);
    }
}
```

## Use Cases

The Proxy Design Pattern is useful in various scenarios, including:

1. **Lazy Initialization**: Defers the creation of expensive objects until they are needed.
2. **Access Control**: Adds a layer of control to ensure that only authorized users can access the original object.
3. **Logging**: Intercepts method calls to log actions before forwarding them to the real object.
4. **Caching**: Stores the results of expensive operations to improve performance for future requests.
5. **Remote Access**: Represents an object located on a different server or address space, making remote calls look like local calls.

## Types of Proxy

1. **Virtual Proxy**: Controls access to an object that is resource-intensive to create, by creating it only when needed.
2. **Protection Proxy**: Manages access rights to an object based on user permissions.
3. **Remote Proxy**: Represents an object that is located on a different server or address space.
4. **Caching Proxy**: Stores results of operations to avoid redundant processing.
5. **Logging Proxy**: Logs interactions with an object for monitoring or debugging purposes.

## Advantages

- **Additional Functionality**: Allows for additional behavior such as logging, caching, and access control without changing the original object.
- **Reduced Complexity**: Simplifies interactions with complex objects by managing access through a proxy.
- **Enhanced Security**: Adds a layer of protection by controlling access and permissions.

## Disadvantages

- **Increased Complexity**: Introduces additional layers of indirection, which can complicate the design.
- **Performance Overhead**: Can introduce overhead due to the extra proxy layer, which may impact performance in some cases.
