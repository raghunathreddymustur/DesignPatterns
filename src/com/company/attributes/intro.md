### **Attributes for Low-Level Design (LLD) Interviews: Mandatory vs. Good-to-Have**

In an **LLD interview**, certain attributes are **mandatory** because they form the foundation of a good design, while others are **good-to-have** because they enhance the design but are not always critical. Below is a sorted list of attributes, categorized as **mandatory** and **good-to-have**, along with explanations and examples.

---

### **🎯 Mandatory Attributes**
These are the **must-have** attributes that interviewers expect you to demonstrate in your design. Without these, your design will likely be considered incomplete or flawed.

#### **1. 🧩 Modularity**
- **Why Mandatory**: Breaking down the system into smaller, independent components is essential for maintainability and scalability.
- **Example**: Separating `PaymentProcessor` and `OrderManager` in an e-commerce system.

#### **2. 🎯 High Cohesion**
- **Why Mandatory**: Ensures each class or method has a single, well-defined responsibility, reducing complexity.
- **Example**: A `UserAuthenticator` class should only handle authentication, not email notifications.

#### **3. 🔗 Loose Coupling**
- **Why Mandatory**: Reduces dependencies between components, making the system easier to modify and test.
- **Example**: Using dependency injection to decouple a `Logger` class from a `PaymentProcessor`.

#### **4. 🚀 Extensibility**
- **Why Mandatory**: Ensures the design can accommodate future changes or new features without major rework.
- **Example**: Using interfaces to allow different implementations of a `NotificationService`.

#### **5. 🧪 Testability**
- **Why Mandatory**: Ensures components can be tested in isolation, which is critical for reliability.
- **Example**: Writing small, independent classes with clear inputs and outputs for unit testing.

#### **6. 📖 Readability**
- **Why Mandatory**: Clean, well-structured code is easier to understand, debug, and maintain.
- **Example**: Using meaningful variable names and following coding conventions.

#### **7. 🛡️ Robustness**
- **Why Mandatory**: Ensures the system handles errors and edge cases gracefully, improving reliability.
- **Example**: Validating inputs and handling exceptions in a `DataProcessor` class.

#### **8. ✨ Simplicity**
- **Why Mandatory**: Avoids unnecessary complexity, reducing the risk of bugs and making the system easier to maintain.
- **Example**: Using simple, clear algorithms instead of overly complex ones.

### **🌟 Good-to-Have Attributes**
These attributes **enhance** your design but are not always mandatory. Demonstrating them can set you apart from other candidates.

#### **1. ♻️ Reusability**
- **Why Good-to-Have**: Reusable components save development time and effort, but not all components need to be reusable.
- **Example**: A `ValidationUtil` class with reusable validation methods.

#### **2. ⚡ Performance**
- **Why Good-to-Have**: Optimizing for performance is important but may not be critical for all systems.
- **Example**: Using efficient data structures like hash maps for fast lookups.

#### **3. 🔄 Consistency**
- **Why Good-to-Have**: Consistent design patterns and conventions improve readability but are not always mandatory.
- **Example**: Using the same naming conventions across all classes.

#### **4. 🔒 Encapsulation**
- **Why Good-to-Have**: Hiding internal details improves security and maintainability but may not always be required.
- **Example**: Using `private` fields and providing `getters` and `setters`.

#### **5. 🧰 Dependency Management**
- **Why Good-to-Have**: Managing dependencies effectively improves modularity but may not always be critical.
- **Example**: Using dependency injection to pass dependencies to a class.

#### **6. ⚠️ Error Handling**
- **Why Good-to-Have**: Proper error handling improves reliability but may not always be mandatory.
- **Example**: Using try-catch blocks and logging to handle exceptions.

#### **7. 📄 Documentation**
- **Why Good-to-Have**: Clear documentation improves understanding but may not always be required in an interview.
- **Example**: Adding Javadoc comments to a `PaymentService` class.

#### **8. ⏳ Concurrency Support**
- **Why Good-to-Have**: Handling multiple tasks simultaneously is important for performance but not always required.
- **Example**: Using thread-safe data structures or synchronization mechanisms.

#### **9. 💾 Resource Efficiency**
- **Why Good-to-Have**: Optimizing resource usage improves performance but may not always be critical.
- **Example**: Using efficient data structures and algorithms.

#### **10. 🔍 Observability**
- **Why Good-to-Have**: Monitoring and debugging components is useful but not always mandatory.
- **Example**: Adding logging, metrics, and tracing to your components.

### **How to Prioritize in an LLD Interview**
1. **Focus on Mandatory Attributes First**:
    - Ensure your design is **modular**, **cohesive**, and **loosely coupled**.
    - Demonstrate **extensibility**, **testability**, and **readability**.
    - Handle **robustness** and **simplicity** by considering edge cases and avoiding complexity.

2. **Add Good-to-Have Attributes if Time Permits**:
    - If you have time, enhance your design with **reusability**, **performance optimizations**, or **consistency**.
    - Mention **encapsulation**, **dependency management**, or **error handling** as additional improvements.

3. **Discuss Trade-offs**:
    - Be prepared to explain why you prioritized certain attributes over others.
    - For example, you might prioritize **simplicity** over **performance** if the problem doesn’t require high efficiency.

### **Example: Applying Attributes in an LLD Interview**

#### Problem: Design a **Parking Lot System**

#### **🎯 Mandatory Attributes**:
1. **🧩 Modularity**:
    - Break the system into modules like `ParkingLot`, `ParkingSpot`, `Vehicle`, and `Ticket`.
2. **🎯 High Cohesion**:
    - Ensure `ParkingSpot` handles only spot-related logic, and `Ticket` handles ticket-related logic.
3. **🔗 Loose Coupling**:
    - Use interfaces to decouple `ParkingLot` from `Ticket` and `Vehicle`.
4. **🚀 Extensibility**:
    - Design `ParkingSpot` to support different types of vehicles (e.g., car, bike, truck).
5. **🧪 Testability**:
    - Write small, independent classes that can be tested in isolation.
6. **📖 Readability**:
    - Use meaningful names like `assignSpot()` and `generateTicket()`.
7. **🛡️ Robustness**:
    - Handle edge cases like a full parking lot or invalid vehicle types.
8. **✨ Simplicity**:
    - Avoid over-engineering; use simple data structures like lists or maps.

#### **🌟 Good-to-Have Attributes**:
1. **♻️ Reusability**:
    - Create a `ValidationUtil` class for reusable validation logic.
2. **⚡ Performance**:
    - Use a hash map for fast lookups of available spots.
3. **🔄 Consistency**:
    - Follow consistent naming conventions across all classes.
4. **🔒 Encapsulation**:
    - Hide internal details of `ParkingSpot` and `Ticket` using `private` fields.
5. **⚠️ Error Handling**:
    - Add exception handling for invalid inputs or full parking lots.

By focusing on **mandatory attributes** first and then incorporating **good-to-have attributes**, you can create a well-rounded design that impresses interviewers and demonstrates your ability to think critically and systematically.
