# **üõ†Ô∏è How to Identify Classes That Come Under Extensibility**

When designing a system, identifying the classes that should be extensible is crucial for creating a flexible and maintainable architecture. Below is a structured guide to help you identify such classes.

---

### üîç **1. Analyze the Requirements**
- **Focus on areas of variability**: Identify parts of the system where requirements are likely to change or grow.
    - Example: Business rules that may evolve or features that are client-specific.
- **Core vs. Peripheral Functionality**:
    - Core functionality is usually stable and less likely to change.
    - Peripheral functionality (e.g., plugins, integrations) is more likely to require extensibility.

---

### üß© **2. Look for Common Patterns in the System**
- **Abstract Behaviors**: Classes that define behaviors or algorithms that may need to be replaced or extended in the future.
    - Example: A `PaymentProcessor` class that might need to support new payment gateways.
- **Reusable Components**: Classes that are shared across multiple modules or features.
    - Example: A `Logger` class that might need to support new logging formats or destinations.
- **Dynamic Features**: Classes that represent entities or processes that are inherently dynamic.
    - Example: A `ReportGenerator` class that might need to support new report formats.

---

### üîó **3. Identify Classes with High Coupling or Dependencies**
- Classes that interact with multiple other components are often candidates for extensibility because:
    - They are more likely to be affected by changes in other parts of the system.
    - Decoupling them through abstraction or extension makes the system more flexible.

---

### üìú **4. Use Design Principles to Guide Identification**
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Classes that are likely to require new functionality should be designed to be open for extension but closed for modification.
    - Example: A `Shape` class in a graphics application that supports new shapes like `Circle`, `Rectangle`, etc., through inheritance or composition.
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Classes with a single responsibility are easier to extend without affecting unrelated functionality.
    - Example: A `NotificationSender` class that can be extended to support new notification channels like SMS or Push Notifications.

---

### üèóÔ∏è **5. Consider Domain-Specific Factors**
- **Domain Models**: In domain-driven design, entities and value objects that represent core business concepts are often candidates for extensibility.
    - Example: In an e-commerce system, a `Product` class might need to support new attributes or behaviors as the business grows.
- **Integration Points**: Classes that interact with external systems or APIs are often extensible to accommodate changes in those systems.
    - Example: A `ThirdPartyAPIClient` class that might need to support new endpoints or authentication mechanisms.

---

### üìä **6. Use UML Diagrams to Visualize Extensibility**
- **Class Diagrams**: Identify classes with multiple relationships or dependencies that might benefit from abstraction or extension.
- **Sequence Diagrams**: Analyze interactions between components to identify areas where new functionality might be introduced.

---

### üõë **7. Avoid Over-Engineering**
- While identifying extensible classes is important, avoid making every class extensible. Over-engineering can lead to unnecessary complexity.
- Focus on:
    - Classes that are **highly likely to change**.
    - Classes that are **central to the system‚Äôs flexibility**.

---

### ‚úÖ **Conclusion**
To identify classes that come under extensibility:
1. Analyze requirements and focus on areas of variability.
2. Look for abstract behaviors, reusable components, and dynamic features.
3. Use design principles like **OCP** and **SRP** to guide decisions.
4. Leverage UML diagrams to visualize relationships and dependencies.
5. Avoid over-engineering by focusing only on classes that are likely to evolve.

By following this approach, you can ensure that your system is designed to handle future changes gracefully.
