# The Restaurant Management System

## 📚 Getting Ready: The Restaurant Management System
Understand the restaurant management system problem and learn the questions to simplify this problem further.

### 🍴 Overview
**A restaurant management system (RMS)** is a software program that helps restaurant owners and managers handle and organize various aspects of their businesses, including:
- Food and beverage sales
- Employee schedules
- Customer reservations

**Key settings for RMS** include quick-service and fine-dining restaurants, and cafeterias. The system streamlines operations, improves efficiency, and enhances customer service.

### 🎯 Goals
The **primary goal of a restaurant management system** is to help restaurant owners and managers streamline and automate tasks, allowing them to focus on providing a high-quality dining experience.

### 🛠 Functionality
An RMS provides restaurant management with control and flexibility over operations from a single location. Key features include:
- Monitoring table availability
- Making reservations
- Generating bills

### 🗂 Expectations from the Interviewee
Several components in a restaurant management system come with specific constraints and requirements. **During interviews**, focus on the following areas:
1. **Restaurant Services**:
    - Does the restaurant provide delivery services?
    - Can customers place online orders?
    - Does the restaurant accept online/card payments?

2. **Restaurant Management**:
    - Can branches vary in terms of services offered?
    - Is inventory management a necessary consideration?

## 📋 Requirements for the Restaurant Management System
Learn about all the requirements essential for designing a restaurant management system.

### 🌟 Importance of Requirement Collection
**Requirement collection is a crucial step** in the restaurant management system design process. It defines the scope of the problem, and getting the requirements right from the interviewer helps ensure a smooth and efficient design process.

### 📝 Requirements List
Below are the identified requirements, labeled as **"Rn"**, where "R" stands for Requirement and "n" is a natural number:
- **R1**: The restaurant can have **multiple branches**.
- **R2**: Each branch will offer a **menu with various sections and items**.
- **R3**: The waiter should be able to **create an order for a table** and add items for each person seated.
- **R4**: Each person’s order can consist of **multiple items**, each corresponding to a menu item.
- **R5**: The system should be able to provide **information about tables currently available** for walk-in customers.
- **R6**: The system should allow for the **reservation of tables**.
- **R7**: The receptionist should be able to **search for available tables by date and time** and make a reservation.
- **R8**: The system should allow customers to **make and cancel reservations**.
- **R9**: The system should send **notifications** as the reservation time approaches.

## 🧩 Design Patterns in the Restaurant Management System
Explore the design patterns used in the restaurant management system and their applications.

### 🔒 Singleton Pattern
The **Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance** and provides a global point of access to that instance.
- **Application**: In the RMS, this pattern can be used for the **database connection**, ensuring there is only one connection to the database and making it accessible to other parts of the system.

### 🛠 Command Pattern
The **Command pattern encapsulates a request as an object**, allowing the request to be parameterized with different data.
- **Application**: In the RMS, this pattern can be used to encapsulate **requests to the database**, such as adding, deleting, or modifying entries. This ensures that views or other components only need to know how to execute the request, not handle it.

### 👀 Observer Pattern
The **Observer pattern allows objects to be notified of changes to other objects**.
- **Application**: In the RMS, this pattern can be used to notify **viewers of changes to the model**, enabling them to update themselves accordingly.

### 🏭 Factory Pattern
The **Factory pattern provides a way to create objects without specifying the exact class** of the object being created.
- **Application**: In the RMS, this pattern can be used to create **different types of menu items**, without needing to specify the exact class of each item.
## 🛠 Additional Requirements for the Restaurant Management System
Explore the additional requirements that can enhance the functionality of the RMS.

### 🎉 Discounts
A **discount** will be applied to the payment depending on special events such as:
- **New Year celebrations**
- **Anniversaries**
- **Branch openings**

The **Payment class** includes a method `applyDiscount()` that:
- Checks if a discount is applicable based on the creation date.
- Applies the discount to the payment amount if eligible.
