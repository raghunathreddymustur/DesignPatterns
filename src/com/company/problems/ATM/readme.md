# Automated teller machine (ATM)

## üöÄ Getting Ready: The ATM System
Understand the ATM design problem and learn the questions to simplify this problem further.

### üìã Problem Definition
An Automated Teller Machine (ATM) allows a bank customer to perform financial transactions remotely without the need for a teller or a bank branch. These transactions include:
- **Deposits**
- **Withdrawals**
- **Balance inquiries**
- **Account transfers**

ATMs are located in convenient locations such as banks, grocery stores, airports, and other public places. To use an ATM:
- Users need a bank card associated with an account at a financial institution.
- Users must also know their Personal Identification Number (**PIN**) to access their account.
- The user inserts their card into the ATM and follows on-screen prompts to complete transactions.

### üéØ Expectations from the Interviewee
There are several components in an ATM design, each with specific constraints and requirements. The following outlines the main expectations:

#### ATM Components
- What are the components of an ATM?
- Is the ATM necessarily placed inside a room?
- Does an ATM have a fingerprint scanner?

#### ATM Features
Different ATMs may vary in features. Consider asking:
- What is the **withdrawal limit** of an ATM?
- Can we **check account balance** using an ATM?
- Can we set a **PIN** using an ATM?

#### ATM Processing
Key processing questions include:
- What happens when the **amount entered exceeds** the user‚Äôs account balance?
- What happens when the amount is greater than the ATM's **cash limit**?
- What happens if the ATM runs out of cash during a transaction?

## üöÄ Requirements for the ATM System
Learn about all requirements of the ATM design.

### üîç Requirement collection
- **R1**: Each user has a single account at the bank that they can access by inserting their card into the ATM.
- **R2**: The main components of the ATM system that facilitate interactions between the user and the machine are:
    - Card reader: To read the user's ATM card
    - Keypad: To enter information such as the user's PIN
    - Screen: To display messages to the user, such as prompts or error messages
    - Cash dispenser: **To dispense cash to the user**
    - Printer: To print receipts for the user
    - Network infrastructure: To connect with the bank's computer system **in order to access account information and complete transactions**
- **R3**: The ATM system must authenticate the user based on the PIN they enter to ensure that **only authorized users can access their accounts**.
- **R4**: All transactions are possible after the successful authentication of the ATM card.
- **R5**: The user can have two types of accounts‚Äîcurrent and savings‚Äîand can perform the following operations on the ATM:
    - Balance inquiry
    - Cash withdrawal
    - **Funds/money transfer**
- **R6**: At the end of a transaction, the user has the option to start another transaction or end their session.
