## üöó Requirements for the Car Rental System

Let's have a look at the requirements for our car rental system. **We'll cover the following:**

---

## üìÑ Requirement Collection

In this lesson, we‚Äôll determine the requirements of our car rental system. **This is a very crucial step as requirements define the scope of a problem, so getting them right from the interviewer and understanding them well will make the design of the rest of the system smooth and easy.**

We‚Äôll use the notational convention to identify each requirement with a unique label **"Rn", where "R" is short for Requirement and "n" is a natural number.**

### Design Pattern

We can utilize the **Decorator Design Pattern** for the car rental system. Here's how it can be designed:

- **Discount Decorator**: Applies discounts to all types of vehicles in the system.
- **Peak Season Decorator**: Increases the fare for vehicles during peak seasons.
- **Damage Fine Decorator**: Calculates the fine for vehicle damage upon return.
- **Partially Filled Fuel Tank Fine Decorator**: Calculates the fine for returning the vehicle with a partially filled fuel tank.

These decorators fulfill the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** and the **Open-Closed Principle (OCP)** of design.
