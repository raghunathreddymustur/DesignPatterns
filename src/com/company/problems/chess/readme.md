# Chess

## ‚ôüÔ∏è Problem Definition
Chess is a **board game for two players** involving strategy, played on a **checkered board of 64 squares** in an 8x8 grid. Each player starts with **16 pieces**, including a **king, queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns**. The goal is to **checkmate the opponent's king**, which occurs when the king is in a position to be captured and cannot escape.
**Key rules include:**
- Each piece has its unique movements:
    - The **rook** moves horizontally or vertically.
    - The **knight** moves in an L-shape.
    - The **bishop** moves diagonally.
    - The **queen** moves in any direction.
    - The **king** moves one square in any direction.
    - **Pawns** move forward but capture diagonally.
- The game can also end in a **draw** under specific conditions such as insufficient pieces, repeated positions, or mutual agreement.

**Note**: We'll design a **digital, two-player version** of chess for online play.

## üéØ Expectations from the Interviewee
### Chess Pieces
Chess pieces follow specific game rules. The following **clarifying questions** may help:
- **How many chess pieces** are there?
- What are their **respective moves**?
- Which piece is the **weakest**?
- Which piece is the **strongest**?

### Gameplay
Gameplay involves achieving **checkmate** or resolving special conditions like **stalemate**. Consider asking:
- Which player takes the **first turn**?
- What are the **game rules**?
- What is **checkmate**, and how does a **stalemate** occur?
- Can a player **forfeit or resign**?

## üîÑ Rules for Situations
### Checkmate
Occurs when a player's king is in **check** and there is no way to escape. This determines the game's **winner**.

### Stalemate
Occurs when the **king is not in check**, but no other moves are possible. This results in a **draw**.

### Forfeiture
If a player does not show up for the game, they are considered to have forfeited.

### Resignation
A player may **resign** if they believe the opponent's victory is inevitable.

### Castling
A strategic move where:
1. The **king moves two boxes toward a rook** on the same row.
2. The **rook moves to the box the king passed over**, next to the new position of the king.
- Both pieces must be in their **original positions** and must not have moved earlier.
- No other piece should be between the king and the rook.

## üé® Design Patterns

The following design patterns have been utilized in the chess game design:

1. **Singleton Design Pattern**
    - Ensures the existence of a **single instance of the chessboard** at any given moment.
    - This is crucial because the chessboard is a shared resource, and multiple instances could lead to an inconsistent game state.

2. **Command Design Pattern**
    - Encapsulates the **move logic** for each chess piece.
    - Each piece has its own implementation of the move command, allowing it to move according to the rules defined for it (e.g., the knight moves in an L-shape, the rook moves horizontally or vertically).

3. **Iterator Design Pattern**
    - Enables the game to move sequentially by allowing the pieces to behave in a uniform manner.
    - This abstracts the underlying logic behind the moves of the pieces from the user.

4. **State Design Pattern**
    - Encapsulates the **state logic** of each piece.
    - Each chess piece has its own implementation of checkmate states, allowing them to behave differently depending on the situation.

5. **Observer Design Pattern**
    - Treats the chessboard as the **subject** and the chess pieces as **observers**.
    - When the state of the board changes, the pieces are notified and adapt accordingly.
    - This decouples the chess pieces from the chessboard.
